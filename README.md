	* Uses assets folder to serve static files to http://url/public
	* Logs 404 errors to the console (Disable this for production environments.)
	* Logs all other errors to the console. (You may or may not want to disable this in production.)
	* Skeleton CSS *Not yet implemented*
	* LESS setup *Not yet implemented*
	* Minification of assets *Not yet implemented*
